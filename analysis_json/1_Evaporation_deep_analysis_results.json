      "current": "English: Many studies have attributed the rapid soil drying during flash droughts to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) using metrics based on VPD anomalies. This study employs an analytical approach to investigate the true role of VPD in soil moisture depletion via evapotranspiration (ET). Using a simplified land-atmosphere slab model, the daily changes in soil moisture are decomposed into contributions from external forcings (like precipitation, wind, radiation) and the system's internal response. Applying this method to 10 major Indian watersheds, the study finds that, contrary to previous research, VPD's contribution is negligible in humid regions but high in arid regions. In arid areas, even a small VPD anomaly can have a large impact due to the high background VPD magnitude, whereas in humid areas, even large anomalies may not significantly affect soil moisture. The results show that previous studies using VPD anomaly metrics have underestimated its influence in arid regions and overestimated it in humid regions.",

To bypass this, this study developed a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to directly predict 10-year flood magnitudes from summary statistics of 19 uncorrected CMIP6 GCMs99. The study finds that ML models are 40% more accurate than hydrologic models driven by bias-corrected GCMs1010. ML models achieve this by rectifying GCM biases, for instance, by adjusting the influence of basin attributes to correct the underestimation of heavy rainfall in wet basins11111111. The results project that by 2100, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, only 34% of rivers will experience larger floods121212.

This study systematically evaluates combinations of five soil resistance methods, eight canopy resistance methods, and two precipitation interception algorithms within the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) framework, using data from 119 FLUXNET sites. The results show that the Ball-Berry-Leuning (C1), unified stomatal (C2), and RL empirical (C5) methods perform best when paired with the power function method (S2) for soil resistance, which is sensitive to surface soil moisture. These top-performing combinations are consistent with major ET products and explain 56% of daily ET variation with an RMSE as low as 1.02 mm/day. However, model accuracy is significantly lower in arid zones, where prolonged water stress reduced R² by 38%. This highlights a critical need for better representation of soil moisture stress in arid regions. The study offers robust, parsimonious, and widely applicable models for ET estimation.

Added 'Trend Analysis' and 'Attribution' to better reflect the methodologies and aims. 'Dryness-Wetness' is a direct translation but could be 'Drying and Wetting Trends' or similar. 'Penman-Monteith' is a key method used."
