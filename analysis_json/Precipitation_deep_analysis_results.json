The ability of GCMs to simulate the characteristics of extreme precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) was systematically assessed, and the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble was used to accurately project extreme precipitation. Furthermore, the response of extreme precipitation over the TP to global warming was explored. The results demonstrated that daily translation efficiently addressed the issue of apparent overestimation in the model’s raw output, and CMIP6 multi-model ensemble mean exhibited better simulation performance for all extreme precipitation indices over the TP. Additionally, the simulation performance of each index exhibited a divergence across various elevation bands as altitude increased, with the best and worst performance observed at the altitude bands of 1500–2000 m and above 5000 m, respectively. For future changes in extreme precipitation, the indices representing the amount and intensity of extreme precipitation increase significantly, whereas the indices representing the duration of precipitation decrease. Moreover, the plateau will show a spatial pattern of “wet regions becoming dry and dry regions becoming wet”. The relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature follows a positive and peak pattern over most areas of the plateau, while the response of extreme precipitation to temperature will increase by 0.6 %–52.6 % with rising temperature. The present results have important implications for investigating the impacts of climate change on the water cycle in alpine regions.",
