However, ultraviolet (UV) radiation (280–400 nm) and far-red (FR) radiation (700–750 nm) can also excite photosystems, albeit less efficiently than PAR. This study explores the impacts of explicitly incorporating UV and FR radiation into canopy radiative transfer (RT) and photosynthesis models within a next-generation land surface model (LSM). Using plant measurements under various light sources and intensities, and surface reflections from an eddy-covariance tower, the study validates the improvements. The results suggest that incorporating UV and FR increases mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP) by up to 7.3% and the global GPP by 4.6 PgC per year.

This study explored the relationships between phenology, physiology, and annual GPP to provide viable alternatives for accurate estimation. A statistical model of integrated phenology and physiology (SMIPP) was developed using GPP data from 145 FLUXNET sites to estimate the annual GPP for various vegetation types. By employing the SMIPP model driven by satellite-derived datasets of the global carbon uptake period (CUP) and maximal carbon uptake capacity (GPPmax), the global annual GPP was estimated for the period from 2001 to 2018. The results demonstrated that the SMIPP model accurately predicted annual GPP, with relative root mean square error values ranging from 11.20 to 19.29% for forest types and 20.49–35.71% for non-forest types. However, wetlands, shrublands, and evergreen forests exhibited relatively low accuracies. The average, trend, and interannual variation of global GPP during 2001–2018 were 132.6 Pg C yr− 1, 0.25 Pg C yr− 2, and 1.57 Pg C yr− 1, respectively. They were within the ranges estimated in other global GPP products. Sensitivity analysis revealed that GPPmax had comparable effects to CUP in high-latitude regions but significantly greater impacts at the global scale, with sensitivity coefficients of 0.85 ± 0.23 for GPPmax and 0.46 ± 0.28 for CUP. This study provides a simple and practical method for estimating global annual GPP and highlights the influence of GPPmax and CUP on global-scale annual GPP.",

We investigated the response of vegetation phenology to climatic factors during extreme events in arid and semi-arid regions of the Chinese Loess Plateau, using the climate water deficit method, to identify extremely dry and wet events. The results revealed that extremely wet events extended the vegetation growth periods in addition to global warming, whereas extremely dry events did not completely counteract this effect. During different extreme events, phenological changes in vegetation on the Loess Plateau were primarily influenced by the interactive effects of climatic factors. During extremely dry events, a 100 mm increase in precipitation advanced the start of the season by 3.0, 9.2, and 16.7 days in forest, shrubland, and grassland, respectively. During extremely wet events, a 1°C rise in temperature delayed the end of the season by 1.6, 0.6, and 3.8 days in forest, shrubland, and grassland, respectively. These findings provide crucial guidance for improving predictions of plant phenology changes under extreme climatic events and unraveling biosphere–atmosphere feedback cycles.",

      "current": "In recent decades, climate warming has led to an increase in atmospheric water demand, a potential reduction in soil moisture, and a rise in the frequency and intensity of droughts. This has intensified the effects of water stress on plants, leading to more vegetated areas experiencing water stress. Soil moisture (SM) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are considered the two main factors that exert water stress on vegetation activity and terrestrial productivity, thereby affecting the global carbon cycle. Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) is a key indicator of terrestrial productivity. The eddy covariance method is one essential method for accurately estimating GPP, but it cannot provide continuous spatiotemporal data. Therefore, estimating GPP at regional or global scales relies on ecological process models, light-use efficiency models, statistical models, and machine learning models. However, the differences in the responses of such GPP products to water stress remain unclear, particularly regarding response direction and response speed ('sensitivity'). This study investigates these differences using nine GPP products, analyzing their responses to RSM and VPD. The study reveals consistent patterns in response directions and sensitivities among the products, but also highlights significant regional discrepancies. The findings emphasize the need for employing multiple indicators in related research to ensure robust results and provide an angle for improving GPP estimation by incorporating factors that influence anomalies of terrestrial productivity.",

      "current": "With over one-third of terrestrial net primary productivity transferring to the litter layer annually, the carbon release from litter serves as a crucial valve in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. However, few quantitative global projections of litter carbon release rate in response to climate change exist. Here, we combined a global foliar litter carbon release dataset (8973 samples) to generate spatially explicit estimates of the response of their residence time (τ) to climate change. Results show a global mean litter carbon release rate (k) of 0.69 year−1 (ranging from 0.09–5.6 year−1). Under future climate scenarios, global mean τ is projected to decrease by a mean of 2.7% (SSP 1–2.6) and 5.9% (SSP 5–8.5) during 2071–2100 period. Locally, the alleviation of temperature and moisture restrictions corresponded to obvious decreases in τ in cold and arid regions, respectively. In contrast, τ in tropical humid broadleaf forests increased by 4.6% under SSP 5–8.5. Our findings highlight the vegetation type as a powerful proxy for explaining global patterns in foliar litter carbon release rates and the role of climate conditions in predicting responses of carbon release to climate change. Our observation-based estimates could refine carbon cycle parameterization, improving projections of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks.",
