      "The paper utilizes a forcing-feedback framework to dissect the sensitivity of urban air temperature to anthropogenic heat flux. Future research could extend this framework to analyze other urban climate drivers (e.g., albedo, vegetation) or incorporate dynamic feedbacks, such as changes in atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "This study provides a mechanistic understanding of urban heat. It opens opportunities for exploring how urban planning decisions (e.g., building density, green space) influence local climate and energy demand, and for developing more accurate urban climate models, especially under scenarios of increasing urbanization and heat exposure."
