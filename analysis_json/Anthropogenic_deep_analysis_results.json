      "current": "Dams and reservoirs have significantly altered river flow dynamics worldwide. Accurately representing reservoir operations in hydrological models is crucial yet challenging. Detailed reservoir operation data is often inaccessible, leading to reliance on simplified reservoir operation modules in most hydrological models. To improve the capability of hydrological models to capture flow variability influenced by reservoirs, this study proposes a hybrid hydrological modeling framework, combining a process-based hydrological model with a machine-learning-based reservoir operation module designed to simulate runoff under reservoir operations. The reservoir operation module employs an ensemble of three machine learning models: random forest, support vector machine, and AutoGluon. These models predict reservoir outflows using precipitation and temperature data as inputs. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) integrates these outflow predictions to simulate runoff. The performance of this hybrid approach is evaluated in the Xijiang Basin within the Pearl River Basin, China. Results highlight the superiority of the SWAT model coupled with machine learning-based reservoir operation models compared to alternative modeling approaches. This hybrid model effectively captures peak flows and dry period runoff, significantly improving the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) compared to original SWAT modules and parameterization techniques lacking dedicated reservoir modules.",

      "current": "Large-scale ecological restoration efforts of the degraded desert steppe ecosystem in northwestern China have effectively combated desertification but have also resulted in the encroachment of shrubs. However, the function of the anthropogenic shrub ecosystem is still unknown under climate change, especially the response of carbon fluxes to drought, which hinders our further understanding of its sustainability in the future. Hence, based on the eddy covariance and environment sensors, continuous carbon and water fluxes and biophysical factors were monitored during 2019–2022 to investigate the characteristics of carbon fluxes and their response to seasonal drought in an anthropogenic shrub ecosystem dominated by Caragana liouana in the southern Mu Us sandy land, northwestern China. The results showed the shrub ecosystem was a stable carbon sink over the 4 years despite large interannual variability, with annual net ecosystem production (NEP) ranging from 54.37 to 150.35 g C⋅m−2⋅y−1. Interannual variability in NEP was mainly due to variation in gross primary productivity (GPP), which is driven by the fact that interannual variability in GPP was higher than interannual variability in ecosystem respiration (Reco). While drought inhibited GPP more than Reco, thus weakening the carbon sequestration ability of the ecosystem during the middle growing season, and thereby carbon fluxes in the shrub ecosystem were significantly suppressed by drought in the middle growing season but slightly in the early growing season. Furthermore, the magnitude and variation of carbon fluxes were determined by the maximum apparent photosynthetic capacity of the canopy (Pmax), leaf area index (LAI), and canopy conductance (gc), all of which are limited by water stress during drought. The work suggests that to keep the carbon sink of anthropogenic shrub ecosystems in arid and semi-arid areas, managers should focus on drought-relief measures in the middle growing season that are better adapted to future climate change.",

      "current": "The terrestrial ecosystem in China mitigates 21%-45% of the national contemporary fossil fuel CO2 emissions every year. Maintaining and strengthening the land carbon sink is essential for reaching China’s target of carbon neutrality. However, this sink is subject to large uncertainties due to the joint impacts of climate change, air pollution, and human activities. Here, we explore the potential of strengthening land carbon sink in China through anthropogenic interventions, including forestation, ozone reduction, and litter removal, taking advantage of a well-validated dynamic vegetation model and meteorological forcings from 16 climate models. Without anthropogenic interventions, considering Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, the land sink is projected to be 0.26-0.56 Pg C a-1 at 2060, to which climate change contributes 0.06-0.13 Pg C a-1 and CO2 fertilization contributes 0.08-0.44 Pg C a-1 with the stronger effects for higher emission scenarios. With anthropogenic interventions, under a close-to-neutral emission scenario (SSP1-2.6), the land sink becomes 0.47-0.57 Pg C a-1 at 2060, including the contributions of 0.12 Pg C a-1 by conservative forestation, 0.07 Pg C a-1 by ozone pollution control, and 0.06-0.16 Pg C a-1 by 20% litter removal over planted forest. This sink can mitigate 90%-110% of the residue anthropogenic carbon emissions at 2060, providing a solid foundation for the carbon neutrality in China.",
