      "current": "Soils support a vast amount of carbon (C) that is vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic global change stressors (e.g., drought and human-induced nitrogen deposition). However, the simultaneous effects of an increasing number of global change stressors on soil C storage and persistence across ecosystems are virtually unknown. Using 1,880 surface soil samples from 68 countries across all continents, we show that increases in the number of global change stressors simultaneously exceeding medium-high levels of stress are negatively correlated with soil C stocks and mineral association across global biomes. Soil C is particularly vulnerable in low-productivity ecosystems (e.g., deserts), which are subjected to a greater number of global change stressors exceeding medium-high levels of stress simultaneously. Our work indicates that the number of global change stressors is a crucial factor for soil C storage and persistence worldwide.",
