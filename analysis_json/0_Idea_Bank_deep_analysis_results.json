This study systematically evaluates combinations of five soil resistance methods, eight canopy resistance methods, and two precipitation interception algorithms within the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) framework, using data from 119 FLUXNET sites9. The results show that the Ball-Berry-Leuning (C1), unified stomatal (C2), and RL empirical (C5) methods perform best when paired with the power function method (S2) for soil resistance, which is sensitive to surface soil moisture1010101010. These top-performing combinations are consistent with major ET products and explain 56% of daily ET variation with an RMSE as low as 1.02 mm/day1111. However, model accuracy is significantly lower in arid zones, where prolonged water stress reduced R² by 38%121212.
