Future research could explore whether similar emergent representations for physical concepts (e.g., water flow, soil moisture dynamics) could arise in LLMs trained on domain-specific hydrological text.",
      "The finding that these representations align with human behavior and neural activity opens doors for using LLMs as cognitive models or as tools to understand human cognition. In a hydrological context, this could lead to new ways of analyzing textual data related to water management, risk perception, or historical hydrological descriptions.",

Future work could investigate methods to better integrate LLM-based conceptual understanding with physical process models or empirical data in hydrological applications."
